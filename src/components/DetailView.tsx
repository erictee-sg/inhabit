            <p>
              Neli Atiga was raised in Auckland, New Zealand as a part of a
              musical Samoan family rooted in generations of pastors, hymn
              composers, and vocalists. A classically trained pianist from the
              age of five, Neli's passion for music deepened through Gospel, Hip
              Hop, and Jazz, eventually leading him to Dj'ing and MCing, band
              performance, and worship leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2000, Neli has served in pastoral ministry with Every
              Nation, beginning as a campus minister in New Zealand, later
              stepping into worship leadership and global worship team training
              in nations and settings around the world, from large worship
              conferences and churches to smaller ministry gatherings and new
              church plants. A theological postgraduate from the University of
              Auckland in New Zealand and Wheaton College in the US, his heart
              burns to see the arts redeemed for Christ and worship leaders
              equipped in both craft and calling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from pastoring in Auckland, Neli has served as a pastor
              alongside his wife Tina in Singapore, and now Brisbane, where they
              lead Every Nation Brisbaneâ€”an intercultural, intergenerational
              church in the heart of the city. Whether in a packed auditorium or
              a bar-turned-sanctuary on Orchard Road, his mission remains the
              same: to create environments where people encounter the presence
              of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is a proud husband and father of three: Nazareth, Zion, and
              Jordan.
